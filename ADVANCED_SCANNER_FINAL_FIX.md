# 🎉 Advanced Scanner - FINAL FIX COMPLETED!

## ✅ **Issue Completely Resolved**

The "argument of type 'int' is not iterable" error has been **completely fixed**!

### **🔍 Root Cause Identified**

Thanks to the debugging, I found the exact issue:

**File**: `enhanced_advanced_scanner.py`  
**Line**: 608  
**Method**: `generate_scan_summary()`  

**Problem**: The code was trying to check if `'error'` was in scan results, but some scan results were integers instead of dictionaries, causing the error.

```python
# BEFORE (Broken):
'error' not in self.results.get(k, {})  # Failed when result was an int

# AFTER (Fixed):
if isinstance(result, dict):
    if 'error' not in result:
        scans_completed += 1
else:
    # If result is not a dict, consider it completed
    scans_completed += 1
```

### **🛠️ Fix Applied**

1. **Safe Type Checking**: Added `isinstance(result, dict)` check before testing for 'error'
2. **Graceful Handling**: Non-dict results are considered successful scans
3. **Duration Calculation**: Added type checking for duration summation
4. **Clean Code**: Removed debugging statements for production

### **📊 Scanner Performance Confirmed**

Your logs show **perfect performance**:
