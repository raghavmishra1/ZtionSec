# 🔧 Advanced Scanner Issues Fixed

## ✅ **Issues Identified & Resolved**

Based on the logs you provided, I've identified and fixed several issues with the advanced scanner:

### **1. SSL Warning Spam Fixed** ✅
**Issue**: Hundreds of SSL warnings cluttering the logs
```
InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made to host 'wish2me.netlify.app'
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Added SSL warning suppression in `enhanced_advanced_scanner.py`
- Implemented proper urllib3 warning filtering
- Clean logs without security scanning noise

### **2. Threat Intelligence Error Fixed** ✅
**Issue**: `"argument of type 'int' is not iterable"` error
```
Error in advanced scan: argument of type 'int' is not iterable
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced error handling in threat intelligence processing
- Added safe dictionary updates with type checking
- Ensured all JSONField values are properly initialized as dictionaries
- Added fallback error handling for database field issues

### **3. Enhanced Error Handling** ✅
**Improvements Made**:
- Better exception handling throughout the scanning process
- Proper scan status updates (running → completed/failed)
- Safe database field handling with null checks
- Graceful degradation when components fail
